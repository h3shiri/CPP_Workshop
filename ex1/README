We applied the converHull algorithm we a simple stack.
firstly we sorted the input by angle in correspondence to thte base point (lowest x value and y value incase of many).
Then we inserted the first two nodes into the stack, from there on we insert whenever we turn right.
In case of a left turn we shall pop the previous element and continue the algo from the re on..)

In addition we implemented the point call rep[resenting a point in the 2 dimenstional field.
On top of that we have the point set class which represents the appropriate mathematical object
aka a set of Points. this has been implemented with a linked list as the underlaying mechanism.
The link list has nodes which have their own seprate class representation .

The overall complexity of the algorithm on a good day is O(nlogn) in our lovely case might be more due to spendful use
of sorting mechanism. 

Thank you for your precious time,
May the force be with you,
Winter is coming!:)
