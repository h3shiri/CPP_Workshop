We build this excersise with few things in mind Inheritance and Polymorphism, in order to make
our design open-closed. The basic class for a point is Point, for an Edge is Edge and so on most
of our classes are self discriptive from the name.

Few clarfications in the inheritance structure:
1) Polygon is our base class for any shape in this project, it behaves like an abstract class
and has several virtual methods in order to make our design open close as much as possible.

2) Triangle and SimpleTrapez both inherent from the polygon class and ovveride all the pure virtual
functions. In addition we use ShapeAlgorithms to calculate various operatoins such as area
and point containment.

In the main driver (aka the Shapes file) we use extenside Polymorphism in order to make our code
extendable in the future. Currently the main bottleneck in our design is the printing due to the
fact we don't currently have a generic printOut function for any Polygon. We internally have
Single choice switch that selects according to name the appropriate printOut function.

Bis vincit qui se vincit in Victoria.
